Multinomial Naive Bayes — These types of classifiers are usually used for the problems of document classification.  It checks whether the document belongs to a particular category like sports or technology or political etc and then classifies them accordingly. The predictors used for classification in this technique are the frequency of words present in the document. 
Bernoulli Naive Bayes — This classifier is also analogous to multinomial naive bayes but instead of words, the predictors are Boolean values. The parameters used to predict the class variable accepts only yes or no values, for example, if a word occurs in the text or not. 
Gaussian Naive Bayes — In a Gaussian Naive Bayes, the predictors take a continuous value assuming that it has been sampled from a Gaussian Distribution. It is also called a Normal Distribution.
